# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, FA1.ipynb and FA 2.ipynb, each featuring a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects.

## FA1.ipynb

This notebook focuses on a variety of analytical techniques, from statistical analysis to predictive modeling.

### Projects:

1.  *Retail Sales Analysis*:
    *   Analyzes retail and warehouse sales data.
    *   Applies the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem to ensure data reliability.
    *   Identifies and visualizes seasonal sales trends.

2.  *California Hospital Readmission Rate Prediction*:
    *   Predicts 30-day hospital readmission rates based on county and hospital type.
    *   Uses a RandomForestRegressor to model the data.
    *   Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variations in readmission rates.

3.  *E-commerce Recommendation Analytics*:
    *   Analyzes online retail data to identify best-selling products and top customers.
    *   Implements a market basket analysis to provide product recommendations.
    *   Offers prescriptive actions based on predictive insights.

4.  *Credit Card Fraud Detection*:
    *   Builds a fraud detection model using transaction data.
    *   Engineers new features like age and hour_of_day to improve model accuracy.
    *   Employs a RandomForestClassifier on a balanced dataset to achieve high recall for fraudulent transactions.

5.  *Telecom Customer Segmentation*:
    *   Segments telecom customers based on their usage patterns (tenure, monthly charges, total charges).
    *   Uses K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups.
    *   Provides interpretations of the segments for targeted business strategies.

## FA 2.ipynb

This notebook covers a range of topics from customer churn prediction to credit scoring, employing various statistical and machine learning models.

### Projects:

1.  *Telco Customer Churn Analysis*:
    *   Performs descriptive and inferential statistical analysis on customer churn data.
    *   Builds and evaluates Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict churn.
    *   Identifies key features influencing customer churn.

2.  *Hospital Readmission Rate Prediction (Classification)*:
    *   Analyzes hospital readmission data over time.
    *   Builds classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict whether a hospital has a high readmission rate.
    *   Evaluates models using cross-validation and ROC AUC scores.

3.  *Store Sales Forecasting*:
    *   Forecasts store sales using a comprehensive dataset including sales, store, oil price, and holiday information.
    *   Engineers time-series features and uses a LightGBM model for prediction.
    *   Includes K-Means clustering to segment product families based on sales and promotion data.

4.  *Credit Scoring Model*:
    *   Develops a credit scoring model to predict the probability of a borrower defaulting.
    *   Uses inferential statistics (t-tests, chi-square) to validate feature significance.
    *   Compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, achieving a high AUC score.
    *   Provides actionable recommendations based on feature importance.

5.  *HR Analytics: Employee Attrition*:
    *   Analyzes HR data to understand factors leading to employee attrition.
    *   Uses K-Means clustering to segment employees into different risk categories based on factors like overtime, job satisfaction, and tenure.
    *   Visualizes the employee risk segments to provide clear insights.
